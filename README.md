<h1>instascrape: powerful Instagram data scraping toolkit</h1>

<h1>What is it?</h1>
InstaScrape is a lightweight JavaScript-based script designed to extract Instagram data efficiently. Developed as a practical tool for data collection, it allows users to gather structured information that can be further processed using standard tools for web scraping, data analysis, and data science workflows.

<h1>What you will get?</h1>
The InstaScrape script scans the comments of a specific Instagram post and outputs the following structured data: Username, Comment, Publish Date, Number of Likes for each comment, Profile URL of the participant, and Avatar URL of the participant. Users are strongly advised to handle this data ethically and responsibly, ensuring the privacy and anonymity of the participants.

<h1>How it works? </h1>
To deploy the project, download the files and install them as a Chrome browser extension. After extracting the contents into a folder, load the folder as an external script using the browser's developer extension settings.

<h1>DISCLAIMER:</h1>
Instagram has gotten increasingly strict with scraping and using this library can result in getting flagged for botting AND POSSIBLE DISABLING OF YOUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. This is a research project and I am not responsible for how you use it. Independently, the library is designed to be responsible and respectful and it is up to you to decide what you do with it. I don't claim any responsibility if your Instagram account is affected by how you use this library.
