<h1>instascrape: powerful Instagram data scraping toolkit</h1>

<h1>What is it?</h1>
InstaScrape is a lightweight JavaScript tool to scrape data from Instagram. This offers a practical way to gather structured information that can be made to work with regular web scraping, data analysis, and data science tools.

<h1>What you will get?</h1>
The application scans the comments of a specific Instagram post and generates a structured output that includes the username, comment, publish date, number of likes per comment, profile URL of the participant, and avatar URL. While this data is free to use, users are strongly encouraged to handle it ethically and responsibly, protecting the privacy and anonymity of participants.

<h1>How it works? </h1>
To use the project, just download the files, and next load the folder as an external script in the browser developer extension control settings.

<h1>DISCLAIMER:</h1>
Instagram has gotten increasingly strict with scraping and using this library can result in getting flagged for botting AND POSSIBLE DISABLING OF YOUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. This is a research project and I am not responsible for how you use it. Independently, the library is designed to be responsible and respectful and it is up to you to decide what you do with it. I don't claim any responsibility if your Instagram account is affected by how you use this library.
