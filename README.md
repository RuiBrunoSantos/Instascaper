<h1>instascrape: powerful Instagram data scraping toolkit</h1>

<h1>What is it?</h1>
instascrape is a lightweight javascript and html package that provides an expressive and flexible API for scraping Instagram data. It is geared towards being a high-level building block on the data scientist's toolchain and can be seamlessly integrated and extended with industry standard tools for web scraping, data science, and analysis.

<h1>What you will get?</h1>
The InstaScrape script scans the comments of a specific post and outputs the following data: <b>Username, Comment, Publish Date, Count Likes for each comment, Profile URL of the participant, and Avatar of the participant</b>.
Use this data ethically to protect the identity of the participants.

<h1>How it works? </h1>
Download the project and simply install it in your Chrome browser as an extension. After unzipping the files into a folder, just select that folder to load it as an external script in the browser.

<h1>DISCLAIMER:</h1>
Instagram has gotten increasingly strict with scraping and using this library can result in getting flagged for botting AND POSSIBLE DISABLING OF YOUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. This is a research project and I am not responsible for how you use it. Independently, the library is designed to be responsible and respectful and it is up to you to decide what you do with it. I don't claim any responsibility if your Instagram account is affected by how you use this library.
